## Application (17 points)

*Failure to use functions taught in class and opting for base R or AI solutions will result in an automatic deduction from each application in which it is used.*

<br>

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you.  All necessary libraries have been pre-loaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

<br>

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction because it demonstrates a lack of understanding.

<br>


### Application 1 (1 points)

A file named `survey.csv` is located in a `data/` subdirectory. Use the appropriate `readr` function to read in the dataset and store it as `survey`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey <- read_csv("data/survey.csv")
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (10 points)

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `height_inches` and `mother_height`.

```{r App2a, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>%
  select(height_inches, mother_height) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs")
```

```{r App2a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Visualize the relationship of `height_inches` by `mother_height` and add the **line of best fit**.

```{r App2b, exercise = TRUE}
  
```


```{r App2b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = mother_height, y = height_inches)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r App2b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 3**

Build a simple linear regression model that predicts `height_inches` using `mother_height`. Store the model as `model_height`. Output the model results using the `summary()` function. 

```{r App2c, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App2c-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_height <- lm(height_inches ~ mother_height, data = survey)
summary(model_height)
```

```{r App2c-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 4**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


**Part 5**

Add the residuals from your model called `model_height` to the code below. The code is started for you to remove missing values. Now you need to:

1. `select` only the variables `height_inches` and `mother_height`
2. Then add a new variable called `residuals` which are equal to the residuals from the model
3. Make sure your results are being output/printed

*You can complete this even if Part 3 is incorrect.*

```{r App2-setup}
model_height <- lm(height_inches ~ mother_height, data = survey)
```

```{r App2e, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2-setup"}
survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height_inches), !is.na(mother_height)) 
```

```{r App2e-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height_inches), !is.na(mother_height)) %>% 
  select(height_inches, mother_height) %>%
  mutate(residuals = residuals(model_height))
```

```{r App2e-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 3 (4 points)

**Part 1**

Build a multiple regression model **with an interaction term** to predict `height_inches` based on `mother_height` and `gender_ident`. 

Output the model results using the `summary()` function. 

The variable `gender_ident` has 2 levels: {Male, Female}

*Those that identify as other were excluded to protect anonymity.*

```{r App3a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_mult <- lm(height_inches ~ mother_height * gender_ident, data = survey)

summary(model_mult)
```


```{r App3a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Suppose a student's mother is 65 inches tall (`mother_height` = 65) and the student is male (`gender_ident` = `Male`). How tall do we predict this student to be?

Use the code chunk below as a calculator to output your prediction (the multiplication symbol is *).

```{r App3b, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r App3b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
29.183402 + 0.557055*65 +6.611474*1 -0.009126*65*1
```


```{r App3b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 4

Using our `survey` dataset, we built a simple regression model to predict `num_party` based on `fav_drink`. Recall `num_party` represents the number of parties a student attends each month.

The model results are shown below:

```{r}
model_party <- lm(num_party ~ fav_drink, survey)

summary(model_party)$coefficients
```


**Part 1 (3 points concept)**

```{r App4-concept}
question_wordbank(
  paste("Using the model output above to answer the following questions. The variable `fav_drink` has 4 levels: {beer, don't_drink, hard_liquor, wine} <br>") ,
  choices = c("What is the baseline/reference level?",
            HTML("Students with what <code>fav_drink</code> level are predicted to on average go to the <b>LEAST</b> number of parties a month?"),
            HTML("Students with what <code>fav_drink</code>  level are predicted to on average go to the <b>MOST</b> number of parties a month?") ),
  wordbank = c("beer", "don't_drink", "hard_liquor", "wine"),
  answer(c("wine","hard_liquor","beer"), correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    correct = "submitted",
    incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```

**Part 2 (2 points)**

Interpret the coefficient labeled **fav_drinkbeer** in the **context of the problem**.

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```
